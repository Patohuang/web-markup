                <h3>Why Stretching Matters</h3>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p>Stretching after a workout is a crucial part of recovery. It helps to reduce muscle tension, improves flexibility, and can even prevent injuries. 
                    By dedicating just a few minutes to stretching, you can increase your range of motion and enhance muscle recovery. Stretching not only helps your 
                    body relax post-workout but also prepares it for future physical activities by maintaining flexibility and mobility.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>The hip flexors allow you to lift your knees and flex at your waist. These muscles are found on the upper thighs, just below the hip bones. To stretch your hip flexors:</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>The iliotibial band (ITB) is a band of tissue that runs outside the hip, thigh and knee. To stretch the ITB:</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>The knee-to-chest stretch focuses on the muscles of the lower back. If you have osteoporosis, avoid this stretch because it may increase the risk of compression fractures in the back bones.
                        To do this stretch:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lie on your back on a firm surface with the backs of your heels flat on the floor.</li>
                        <li>Gently pull one knee up to your chest until you feel a stretch in your lower back.</li>
                        <li>Bring your knee as close to your chest as comfortably possible.</li>
                        <li>Keep your other leg relaxed in a comfortable position, either with your knee bent or with your leg extended.</li>
                        <li>Hold for about 30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Switch legs and repeat.</li>

                    </header>
                    <p>If the back of your shoulder is tight, you can have rotator cuff problems. These problems are more likely if you golf or play overhead racket or throwing sports, such as tennis or baseball. To keep your shoulders flexible:</p>
                    <ol> 
                        <li>Bring your left arm across your body and hold it with your right arm, either above or below the elbow.</li>
                        <li>Hold for about 30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Switch arms and repeat.</li>

                    </header>
                    <p>The shoulder's internal rotators are part of the group of muscles often used in overhead sports activities. These activities can include a tennis serve or an overhead throw. To stretch these muscles:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Grasp a rolled-up towel firmly with both hands, as shown.</li>
                        <li>Gently pull the towel upward with your top hand. You'll feel a stretch in the shoulder of your opposite arm as your lower hand is gently pulled farther up your back.</li>
                        <li>Hold for about 30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Switch hands and repeat.</li>

                <h3>Stretching Tips for Beginners</h3>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p>When stretching, it’s important to move slowly and avoid bouncing, which can strain your muscles. 
                    Stretch to the point where you feel a gentle pull, but not pain. Always breathe deeply and hold 
                    each stretch for at least 20-30 seconds. Over time, you’ll notice improvements in your flexibility, 
                    making it easier to perform exercises and avoid injury. Incorporating stretching into your routine 
                    will help you feel more relaxed and flexible, aiding in both recovery and overall well-being.</p>
